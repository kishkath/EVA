Here, we are gonna build the model with a decent architecture having following conditions:

   - Less than 10K parameters
   - Less than 16 Epochs
   - Target is 99.4% (consistent approach towards the target)


## B. Steps for building the code of neural network:

1. Importing libraries
2. Creating Custom Dataloader class
3. Loading the datasets & transforming images via batches are per our targets.
5. Set up configurations regarding the processors
6. Building the Intuition for developing the architecture
7. Building Model Architectures & knowing Parameters.
8. Training and testing by passing loaded train & val datasets.
9. Training for desired EPOCHS.
10. Checking the plots of losses & analysis them.
