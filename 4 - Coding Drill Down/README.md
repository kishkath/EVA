Here, we are gonna build the model with a decent architecture having following conditions:

   - 1. Less than 10K parameters
   - 2. Less than 16 Epochs
   - 3. Target is 99.4% (consistent approach towards the target)

1. Description about Model

2. Results: 
    - 1. Parameters:
    - 2. Epochs    : 
    - 3. Accuracy  : 
  
3. Analysis:
