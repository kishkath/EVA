**Neural Network**
==================

#### Description

    Know About Neural Network: A Neural Network is a combination of several layers which together combinely called as "Network" and as they contain small circles called as neurons which is used for storage/computation/transfer of data. These neurons are connected by a line/wire/thread/medium(information passer) where weights are placed and bias at the entire layer is used as it is historically defined. The first layer of netowrk is called Input Layer & last is called Output Layer and the rest in between are called as, hidden layers (we really dont know what's happening) üòÆ‚Äçüí®.
  
 * So, here we are using this type of network and trying to predict the handwritten digits which are stored in form of pixel values in a 2D-Matrix of shape (28,28)
 * as well as the random number that is generated.
 * Visualized network is shown below.
 
**Tech-stack**
--------------
1. Python - for coding.
2. Pytorch - used as framework for building neural network


**Statement**
=============
* Building a Neural network that will take 
  - 2 inputs: 

       ***input1***: an image from the MNIST dataset (say 5)
       
       ***input2***: a random number between 0 and 9, (say 7)
       
  - 2 outputs:
  
      ***output1***: "number" that was represented by the MNIST image (predict 5)
      
      ***output2***: "sum" of this number with the random number and the input image to the network (predict 5 + 7 = 12)
