* As of need, 4 convolution blocks are used with total of 12 layers in-it. The architecture also contains the dilation convolution (1-layer) and depthwise (1-layer) along with pointwise(1-layer). It summarizes as 9 convolution layers + 1 Dilation layer + 1 Depthwise seperable convolutions are used and they made up the number of **parameters as: 1,91,514**
