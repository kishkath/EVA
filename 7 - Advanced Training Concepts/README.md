## ResNet (CIFAR10_ResNet18)
------------------------------

**Session-7: Advanced Training Concepts** - Describing about model explainability via usage of GRADCAM, and usage of learning rates and its values,
different optimizers and its comparisons and its counter-parts.

Assignment: 



### The Repo contains 

      A. CIFAR10_ResNet18.ipynb: A jupyter notebook, which executes the resnet-18 layered implementation. The files are being imported from repo: 
                                 The complete implementation is based on importing files and classes and its methods. 
                                 
      B. MiSCLASSIFIED_IMAGES  : Image which are mis-classified.
      
      C. GRADCAM Images.pdf    : Images are plotted and cut and pasted in document.
      
      
* The model runs for 20 EPOCHS and got the training-accuracy of 96% & validation-accuracy of 83%.
